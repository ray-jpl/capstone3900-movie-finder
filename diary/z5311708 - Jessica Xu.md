Week 1
This week we have formed group with 5 members and elected Raymond Li to be the group's scrum master. After group discussions, we have decided to do the Movie Finder project and brainstormed some functionalities as a group.

Week 2
This week I have been assigned to draft up the user stories for our functionalities as well as decide on the novel functionalities that would be suitable for our group to do. As such, the group has agreed to do with my proposed novel functionalities:
- Like/Dislike a review
- Level system/Achievement based on how many movies youâ€™ve watched (title based on level) 
We started scheduling regular check-in meetings outside the tut and will have meeting minutes documented here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15YA2AzSQuk7yISz0XU6WHaGpPwDITVkqTspdYDj2Z-Y/edit?usp=sharing, and I will note the minutes during meetings. 
We have also decided that we will be coding with Python for backend and started to distribute the workload. I have been assigned to work on Background Research and User stories and Sprints with Steve and Andrew whilst Nick and Raymond will work on Technical depth, scale, report formatting for the project proposal.

Week 3
This week our group finished with our project proposal that was due on Monday 06/03. I specifically worked on the section of User stories and Sprints, and worked with Raymond to ensure that the project proposal was consistent with any Jira updates related to user stories whenever either had to be changed. We changed one of our novel functionalities (from like/dislike a review to a discussion forum under each movie) since we realised that our initial idea was not "novel" enough. Specificlaly, this function will be one discussion forum per movie for users to engage in discussion topics on the movie with other users. However, discussions from blacklisted users will not be visible to the users who have blacklisted them. Lastly, I will be looking into somme Django tutorials before our next tutorial meeting as we will be using that in our project too, and will start my coding parts for backend soon.

Week 4
This week our group has been frantically coding the front and backend for our project. I specifically was tasked to work on the backend for our reviews objective, including viewing reviews and ratings, posting reviews and ratings, and updating the overall rating score each time a new review and rating is posted. It has been a stressful week and we are preparing for our lab-time demo and the retrospective that will be due later on. Group members have been highly supportive of each other and worked very hard, providing assistance to others when needed in a timely manner. Thanks team :)

Week 5
This week our group has completed and submitted our retrospective report, and are continuing the frontend and backend. I was tasked to work on the blacklist function, including getting, adding and removing blacklist users, and updated reviews and ratings such that logged in users will not have to see reviews by users they have blacklisted, and ratings by blacklisted users will not affect the movie rating as seen by the user who blacklisted them.

Week 6
This week our group has been continuing to work on the coding, as well as the group report. I have completed the backend for the blacklisting users with the functions mentioned before.

Week 7
This week I found out that the blacklist function, specifically re-calculating the ratings of movies such that blacklisted users would not affect the overall rating as seen by the logged-in user, was not working properly. So I tried to fix it but I don't think it worked so Raymond helped me fix it. 

Week 8
This week we did the demo presentation. I prepared the document for the retro according to the new requirements, and we held a meeting to fill out that document and submitted it on time. I am also starting to prepare our final project report.

Week 9
This week I have prepared the general structure of our project report according to the report requirements.


Week 10
This week we are wrapping up the project. We had a practice session to go through our final demo and the team identified some bugs along the way and fixed them. I will finish up the project report.
