Week 1:
In week 1, we firstly formed our group based on common interests and our diverse skillset having members with experience in frontend while others who prefer to be in the backend role. We then selected Raymond as our scrum master and were deciding between the Movie Finder System and the Mortgage Management System. After a collaborative discussion between the pros and cons, we decide the Movie Finder System was the best choice for us as it would be easier for us to construct user stories and relate back to the overall ‘problem’. We then started to brainstorm some functionalities of this system. 

Week 2:
In this week, we started exploring the software we were going to use for the frontend, backend and the database for our entire project. Based on our comfortability and previous experience, we decided to use Tailwind, Django and PostgreSql. We additionally started to construct our user stories and had a meeting to delegate the roles for proposal report. 

Week 3:
In week 3, we wanted to consolidate our functionalities with our tutor to ensure that we were meeting the requirements of the project. We decided to go through a new novel functionality which included a social space for our movie review system. Furthermore, we each made progress on our own parts of the project proposal and discussed any confusions in the specifications in our meeting. We then went through the report together to edit and finalise our sections before handing it in.

Week 4:
This week I started using dJango and installed the postgreSQL to start experimenting with the data. I then started writing backend functions to get the top 25 movies and the relevant details needed for the frontend. I also wrote the function for movies details and separated an index for each movie id. I tested these results to ensure it displays properly for each given URL.

Week 5:
In week 5, I cleaned up the details for the each movie for the project check in. Along with that, I was also testing around the movie homepage so that it will display the relevant details clearly which will be used by the frontend.

Week 6:
Week 6 was the time I spent some time thinking on how to blacklist users for the discussion forum and what that would require us to adjust in the data.sql file. 

Week 7: 
In week 7 I started working on the discussion forum and creating relevant URLs that are specific for each movie. I then realised that we need to take into account on the reviewerId for blacklisting certain users so I implemented that for getting the discussion forum. I did some further testing in the backend by returning the certain messages that should be seen to match the blacklisting functionality. I also implemented the function to add a message into the discussion forum.

Week 8: 
In this week, I was preparing for the lab demonstration and working with Nick, our frontend developer to make sure that posting in the forum is working properly. We also made sure that most recent messages would be displayed first in the discussion forum as well as the blacklist functionality working where messages will disappear from the forum when certain users are blacklisted. 

Week 9:
This is the week where we prepared for the retrospective and reflected on what changes we needed to do in preparation for the final demonstration. I was in charge of ensuring the wishlist of every user is displayed by rating where highest rating of a movie would appear first. I also added backend functionality for editing and deleting messages for the discussion forum. Moreover, I also completed the backend functionality for profile title and tested it out to ensure that it complied with the frontend.

Week 10:
Finally, in week 10, I was tidying up the code and preparing for our final demonstration. I also started writing the functionality of our functions in our final report. Moreover, I also met up with my team to run through what we were going to speak about in the final demonstration and assigned ourselves some roles.
