#### Week 1
This week we just formed a group and it was decided that I would be the scrum master. 
As the scrum master I directed discussions to decide on which project to do. We ended up debating between the Movie Finder and also the Mortgage Management System. In the end we thought that the Movie Finder was a topic that was more relatable to us as a team and it would be easier for us to write user stories. 
We ended up brainstorming novel functionalities together so that we could pick the ones we liked.

#### Week 2
This week our group needed to write the user stories so that I could put them into the Jira for the sprint. It was decided that other group members would brainstorm user stories and I would set up the development environment. I decided to use Nextjs and Tailwind for frontend development as I have some experience using it before and it feels much easier and quicker to build an MVP using those. My other teammate Nicholas Liu, who is the other team member helping to do front end work was ok with this decision as he has used React before and open to trying the frameworks. The other team members were not familiar with Javascript and wanted to use Python for backend. Therefore we opted to try using Django which is new to all of us but we hope we can adapt quickly. For the database we are using postgreSQL as most of us had done COMP3311 and used it before. 

### Week 3
This week I worked on finalising the report for the submission. I finalised the Jira user stories, helped Nicholas with deciding on the story board details and ensured that the report contained all the relevant information. Other than the report I started some front end work, making a boilerplate layout to use for each page and also creating a navbar mockup. We haven't decided what accent colour to use but we can continue development without deciding as we can always change it later. I also assigned Nicholas to work on designing the signup/login pages as he has less experience using tailwind and I think a small component like that will make it easier for him to pick up the basics. Next week I will hopefully be able to design the homepage and navbar.

### Week 4
This week we began implementing the website. I was in charge of front end and I made the home page, the movie details page, the reviews and review input as well. The others in the group got stuck with Django authentication and I didn't have and opportunity to implement it into my pages. Members of the group were also struggling still with the Docker and Postgres setup which Steve and I helped everyone to configure. Now the frontend components are functional and have some styling however there are extra quality of life additions I would include if I have time in the next sprints such as collapsible reviews. 


### Week 5
This week was the demo, I had finished my tasks and I just integrated the login information once it was fully completed. We also conducted the retrospective this week and we all wrote down some issues we had with how the demo went. Personally I think everyone fell behind and we had issues setting up docker which was not helpful. 

### Week 6
This week is flex week, I spent some free time thinking of how to change the UI as the tutor had commented that it was not that user friendly. I went back to the lecture notes and took note of some principles to consider when redesigning. However didn't get much time to do any coding. 

### Week 7
This week I worked on redesigning the UI to a dark theme to look more sophisticated. We also decided on using Orange as our accent colour which made design decisions a lot easier. Working on the redesign took a lot of time as I had to redo the CSS for a lot of elements. After that I needed to update reviews to implement the blacklist functionality. To do that I created Modals to make the whole process more user friendly. I also included modals in the login screens and other sections to make it more user friendly as well. 

I made sure that blacklisting updates the total rating properly to make the design more responsive. Additionally I made the recommendation system which reused components I made from the previous sprint which saved a lot of time. 

### Week 8
Demo Presentation. After the presentation I worked on the retro, didn't do any coding over the Easter long weekend so not much to report.


### Week 9
This week I worked on implementing search. Steve had finished the backend for search functionality earlier in the week so I was able to work on it. Other than working on search I helped Nick a little bit with profile system and fixing up code issues we identified in the retro.

### Week 10
This week I just worked on cleaning up print statments/console.log, formatting and adding more comments to hopefully improve our software quality score.  I also added more detail to some of the movie data in data.sql file to make it appear more sophisticated. I also conducted a practice session to go through our final demo where I managed to find small functional bugs that we were able to fix.
