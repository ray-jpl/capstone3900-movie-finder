# Development Setup

First have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed


Run `docker-compose build` to get install dependancies. This will take a minute or two to finish. You will have to rebuild if you want to see any new changes you have made

Then run `docker-compose up` to start

__Frontend development has alternative commands to make development easier however docker-compose will still be needed to test API functionality__

Frontend is running on localhost:3000
Backend is running on localhost:8000
DB is running on localhost:5432?

The current tech stack is 
Frontend
- Nextjs

Backend
- Django

Database
- PostgreSQL
